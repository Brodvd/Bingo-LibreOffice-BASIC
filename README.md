# The-Bingo-Game-In-LibreOffice-BASIC
This is a simple bingo game that I found at this link: [https:///forum.openoffice.org/it/forum/viewtopic.php?t=t4804](url)

In addition to being the classic game of bingo I found this file very interesting to learn the main notions of BASIC.
# Correction
I have improved some bugs compared to the original version.
If anyone wants the original file go on the link above.
# Installing
The file can be download directly on the list of this page. 
There are two version, one in italian and one in english.
# Future version
For this game I don't think that I will make and enveloper a new version.
